# NexusRepoManager
This is a repository to showcase my Nexus artifact repository manager project, for the TWN DevOps Bootcamp. I ran Nexus on a DigitalOcean droplet server and published artifacts to the Nexus repository.

## Project Description

1. I installed and configured Nexus from scratch on a DigitalOcean droplet server.
2. I then created a new User on the Nexus repository with relevant permissions.
3. For the Java Grade project, I then built a JAR artifact and uploaded it to the Nexus repository.
4. For the Java Maven project, I also built a JAR artifact and uploaded it to the Nexus repository.

**I have included .md files (markdown files) to specify the Bash CLI commands and steps used to carry out specific tasks in the project.

## Acknowlegement
I would like to thank Nana and TWN for the opportunity to delve into the world of DevOps engineering through the TWN DevOps Bootcamp. Nana's approach to teaching is very effective and I feel concepts are introduced with the right amount of depth, whilst ensuring you are not overwhelmed with technical jargon, techniques, or tools. She has made a task that initially felt like a mountain to climb without directions, straightforward. I no longer had to worry about whether I was learning the correct concepts or missing out on any important information or skills. Thanks TWN!
